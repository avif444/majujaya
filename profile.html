		<p>More than 20 years ago, our founder, Abi Bakir, and a hand- ful of CV Lumpur Sehat employees shared a dream of creating an industry-leading firm dedicated to making the world a better place. On April 6, 2004, PT Maju Jaya evolved to become an in- dependent firm. While our official founding was in 1990, some of our predecessor firms had distinguished histories dating back to the early 1900s.</p>
		<p>Since then, more than 40 companies have joined PT Maju Ja- ya, and in 2007, we became a publicly traded company on the Jakarta Stock Exchange.</p>
		<p>Today, listed on the Forbes as one of Indonesia’s largest companies, PT Maju Jaya's talented employees — including ar- chitects, engineers, designers, planners, scientists and man- agement professionals — now serve clients in more than 130 countries around the world. </p>
		<p>PT Maju Jaya’s technical expertise and creative excellence come from the rich history of some of the world’s finest engi- neering, environmental, construction management as well as planning and design companies. From transportation, energy and water systems to enhancing environments and creating new buildings and communities, our vision remains constant — to make the world a better place.
		</p>
		<p>What sets us apart is our collaborative way of working globally and delivering locally. A trusted partner to our cli- ents, we draw together teams of engineers, planners, archi- tects, landscape architects, environmental specialists, econo- mists, scientists, consultants, as well as cost construction, project and program managers dedicated to finding the most in- novative and appropriate solutions to create, enhance and sus- tain the world’s built, natural and social environm
